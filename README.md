# Sentiment Analysis using RandomForest Classifier

## Overview
This repository contains Python code for performing sentiment analysis on review data using a RandomForest classifier. The code processes the textual data using `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfTransformer`, trains a RandomForest classifier, and evaluates its performance on a test dataset.

## Usage
### Prepare your data:

- Ensure you have rev.csv for training and reviews.csv for testing in the same directory as your script.
- The data should be in CSV format with the appropriate columns for text and labels.

### Run the script:

- The script will read the data, process it, train the model, make predictions, and evaluate the model's accuracy.

## Results

#### Achieved an accuracy of 54% on the test Dataset.
